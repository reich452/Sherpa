If forces you to become a better Apple programmer by flowing their best practices. It's free! It's organic, you don't need a dependency or cocoapod. Back referencing is convenient for your objects. The CloudKit dashboard is easy to use. However, when working with it, portions of it tend to be slow and feels bulky. It can be tricky working with images (CKAssets) with CloudKit. It's a thick process to fetch images"), Author(name: "CloudKit", detail: "Records are at the heart of all data transactions in CloudKit.

It's really cool how they give you different options of Authentication. Firestore is smooth when saving and fetching images. You can have a property as a image string in your model rather than going through CloudKit's cumbersome process of CKAssets for images. You can import and export JSON directly from Firebase."), Author(name: "Firebase", detail: "Less code.", pro: "In this project, it took less code to set up Firebase.", con: "The documentation is great, however it took me slightly longer to search through Firebase's documentation.
